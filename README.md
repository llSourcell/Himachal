Himachal is a social networking app that lets you share videos with friends. You don't need to tag your videos, the app will do it for you using machine learning. 

Features
 -Discovery (Search for videos by their autogenerated tags)
 -Video Sharing (upload your own short videos) 
 -Following friends
 -Facebook integration
 
 
Social networking apps are super overdone, but this was something I wanted to do because 

A it was a way to implement machine learning which I'm super into.  
B I wanted to create a super optimal networking, data persistence, and concurrency stack. I'm going to continually optimize these 3 things.
